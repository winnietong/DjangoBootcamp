# DjangoBootcamp
Django Bootcamp

Since a lot of you have asked me what going through a coding bootcamp was like,
I decided to dig up some old notes and share some of it with you guys.

Please note, this is in no way a replacement for learning how to code. This repository only contains
the notes and a couple of homework assignments that we've done in class. While it won't teach you
to be a coding genius, it will certainly give you an idea of what to expect in a coding bootcamp.

If you'd like to learn a little more about my experience, you can check out my blog here:
[Agile in heels](http://agileinheels.com/rocketus-10-week-python-bootcamp-successfully-completed/)

## Week 1
Basics of Python including some OOP.

## Week 2
OOP, Database design, and miscellaenous topics such as regex, file read and write, 
map, reduce, filter, generators, decorators, etc...

## Week 3-10, coming soon!
